@link["http://adventofcode.com/day/22"]{The puzzle}. Once again, our @link-rp["day22-input.txt"]{input} tells us the boss's stats.

@section{You're a Wizard, Henry}

The rules of the game are different this time.
Instead of items, attack power, and defense power, we have mana and spells.
The boss still has a fixed attack power, so we'll use a 3-element @racket[struct]
 to model the player and boss.

@chunk[<day22-player>
       (require racket rackunit)
       (provide (all-defined-out))

       (define BASE-HP 50)
       (define BASE-MANA 500)

       (struct player (hp attack mana) #:transparent)

       (define (make-player)
         (player BASE-HP 0 BASE-MANA))

       (define (make-boss hp attack)
         (player hp attack 0))

       (define (hp+ p val)
         (match-define (player hp attack mana) p)
         (player (+ hp val) attack mana))

       (define (hp- p val)
         (hp+ p (- val)))

       (define (mana+ p val)
         (match-define (player hp attack mana) p)
         (player hp attack (+ mana val)))

       (define (mana- p val)
         (mana+ p (- val)))

]

Next, a few constants and helper functions to model spells.
The key functions are @racket[apply-spell], which represents the actions a player
 can take during their turn, and @racket[apply-effect], which implements the
 delayed action of the @racket[shield], @racket[poison], and @racket[recharge] spells.
Both functions are parameterized over the player, boss, and current active
 spells.
These three values represent the game state at any moment.

@section{What's the least (mana) we can spend and win?}

Starting with 50 health, 500 mana and a boss with @math{N} hit points and @math{A}
 attack points, the least mana we can spend and win is either:
@itemize[
  @item{
    The cost of one @emph{Magic Missile}, plus the least-mana solution for
     a player with @math{50 - M} hit points, @math{500 - 53} mana,
     and a boss with @math{N - 4} hit points.
  }
  @item{
    The cost of one @emph{Drain} spell, plus the least-mana solution for
     a player with @math{50 + 2} hit points, @math{500 - 73} mana, and
     a boss with @math{N - 2} hit points.
  }
  @item{
    The cost of one @emph{Shield} spell, plus the least-mana solution for:
    @itemize[
      @item{
        a player with @math{50 - max(1, (M - 7))} hit points and @math{500 - 113} mana,
      }
      @item{
        a boss with @math{N} hit points,
      }
      @item{
        the @emph{Shield} spell active for 4 more turns.
      }
    ]
  }
  @item{
    The cost of one @emph{Poison} spell, plus the least-mana solution for
     a player with @math{50 - 7} hit points and @math{500 - 173} mana and
     a boss with @math{N - 6} hit points, given that the @emph{Poison} spell
     is active for 4 more turns.
  }
  @item{
    The cost of one @emph{Recharge} spell, plus the least-mana solution for
    a player with @math{50 - 7} hit points and @math{500 - 229 + (101 * 2)} mana
    against a boss with @math{N} hit points, given that the @emph{Recharge} spell
    is active for 3 more turns.
  }

The correct alternative is the one that happens to be cheapest.
Since we've outlined the alternatives and know the end conditions for the game,
 we can write an algorithm that tries every alternative and returns the best
 sequence of spells.

Never mind the @racket[hard-mode?] parameter for now.

@section{Hard Mode}

On hard mode, the player loses one hit point on their turn.
Thanks to the optional keyword argument to @racket[win/least-mana], the answer
 is easy find.

@section{Testing Day 22}

The algorithm as written is very slow.
Unfortunately, there's no better way to solve this problem than trying everything,
 but while the tests are running, think about what kind of caching strategy could
 improve performance.

       (module+ test
         (define input-str (file->string "day22-input.txt"))

         (check-equal? (q2 input-str) 1309))]
